Some of them were for class such as Design Systems, Processes & Contextes, while others were made during my time as a Digital Marketing Intern for Northeastern's Residential Life and Housing Services. All these posters were either done in Adobe Photoshop or Illustrator.

              <p>Our final project for Design Processes, Contexts, and Systems required us to map out an entire experience of any activity. This activity could be as mundane or as interesting as possible. I decided to go with the laundry cycle. It was a good way to interview a lot of students with different perspectives. In this document not only does this contain my final poster, but it also contains my whole design process. It includes points about what I heard from interviewees, first drafts, and a low fidelity prototype of a solution.</p>

              <br>
              <p><i>English: How did it Become the Global Language?</i> is a project that was done in Design Processes, Contexts, and Systems. for this assignment we were required to pick a question you've wondered for a while and make an infographic about it. I always wondered why English was the language used globally. How did English become the lingua franca?

                <br><br> This assignment was actually hard for me. First off, most infographics included statistics. However, this subject was more about history rather than current numbers, so it was decently hard to summarize history into a few words. Also, there were a lot of reasons why English became the common language. However, I decided I would just pick the four biggest events that really defined the language's history. <br><br>Everything was made through Adobe Illustrator.</p>

              <br>
              <p>During my time as a digital marketing intern, I was given the task to make advertisements for Northeastern's annual Midnight Breakfast. These posters would be displayed not only on the housing's social media, they would be printed out and displayed around campus. That is why there is two copies of the advertisement. One has all information needed and a bit more, while the smaller version is just a very quick blurb of the most important points. I was thinking that the first flyer would be the used for posting around campus and once online, while the second flyer would be more of a quick reminder that an event is happening.<br><br> With this project, I decided I wanted to go for a more neon lights feel. This was my first ever time making something look somewhat neon-like. Also, I tried my best trying to make breakfast foods have some night imagery. For example, the egg and pepper represents the moon and stars, the sausage has "zzz"s grilled on them, and the croissant had the shape of a moon and a sleeping bag. All of this project was done purely through Adobe Illustrator, and all assets on the poster were made by me.</p>

              <br>
              <p>As a digital marketing intern, I was given the task to redo the flyers for all the 19 living learning communities. For all first year students, rather than selecting a building/dorm to live in, you pick which community. These communities vary in interests to living with people who have the same major as you.

                <br><br>

              This project was made with both Photoshop and Canva. I would've completely used Photoshop on it's own or used Indesign, but there was already written content on Canva. The background photos are the buildings of where each living learning community is at. Otehr than the overall layout and colors, all assets were handed to me for me to use.</p>
